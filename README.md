- 👋 Hi, I’m @oPaws
- 👀 I’m interested in language learning, but not good at chatting sometimes you know
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JLPT and Ielts for the coming examinations, hoping it would be in a good result
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on life skills as well as game skills, neither of which can I handle so it makes me lonely somehow
- 📫 How to reach me? If you feel like email, send me at 9s.opaw@gmail.com, maybe days for one reach; if anything else, may you contact me here in person
- 🙏 Thank you for coming here
